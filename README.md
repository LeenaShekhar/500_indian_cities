## Kaggle dataset: Exploring Top 500 Indian Cities

#### Objective:

1. In the notebook I tried exploring the dataset about top 500 Indian cities. I tried to compare the cities based on the following parameters:

  1. Population
  2. Graduate population
  3. Literacy rate
  4. Sex ratio

2. I also used plotly library for the first time to create scattergeo plots.
